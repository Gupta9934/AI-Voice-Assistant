# AI-Voice-Assistant
Jarvis is a voice assistant developed by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to manage his home and work tasks. It is named after the AI system in the Iron Man movies. The acronym stands for "Just A Rather Very Intelligent System".

The Jarvis voice assistant is designed to work with a variety of devices, including smartphones, smart home appliances, and personal computers. It uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to understand and respond to voice commands. Users can interact with Jarvis using a variety of methods, including text messaging, Facebook Messenger, and voice commands.

Some of the tasks that Jarvis can perform include playing music, setting reminders, controlling the temperature and lighting in a room, and providing information on news, weather, and traffic. Zuckerberg has described the development of Jarvis as a personal challenge, and he has released a series of videos documenting its progress.

While Jarvis was initially developed as a personal project for Zuckerberg, the technology behind it has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, including home automation, customer service, and personal assistants for businesses.
